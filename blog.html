    <h3>var, let, const</h3>
    <p>In javascript we can declare a variable by var, let, and const.<br>
        (i) var : If we declare a variable by var, it will become global variable. and it will access from any where. By var we can declare same named variable.And We can reinitialize value any time.<br><br>

        (ii) let : If we declare a variable by let, it will become scope variable. and it can't be access from any where.It can only access in functional scope. By let we can't declare same named variable.But We can reinitialize value any time.<br><br>

        (iii) const: If we want to declare a const variable,, we must initialize its value when we declare const variable. After decalring const variable we can not reinitialize its value.And also can not declare same named variable. <br>
    </p>
    <h3>null and undefined</h3>
    <p>
        null : null is an empty value.its means there is no value.<br>
        undefined : when we declare a variable but not assigned its value,, and we want to do some operation by this variable its show undefined.<br><br>
    </p>
    <h3>REST API</h3>
    <p>API : means Application Programming Interface. By rest api we can load data from server site to client site. REST API request server to get data from database.
